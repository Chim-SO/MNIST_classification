# MNIST classification:  
This repository contains the code examples of my medium tutorial "A Brief Introduction to Neural Networks : a Classification Problem".
 In this tutorial, we create, train and validate three types of models:  
 * The first model is a simple straightforwawrd model with a single input unit.
 * The second model is a straightforward model with one-hot encoded output.
 * The third model is a CNN-based model.

"A Brief Introduction to Neural Networks" tutorial is beginner-friendly in which we will simply investigate several types of neural networks:  
* Tutorial 1: 
  * [A Brief Introduction to Neural Networks : A Regression Problem](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/a-brief-introduction-to-neural-networks-a-regression-problem-c58c26e18008)
  * [Github](https://github.com/Chim-SO/introductiontomachinelearning)

* Tutorial 2:
  * [A Brief Introduction to Neural Networks : a Classification Problem]()
  * [Github](https://github.com/Chim-SO/MNIST_classification).

In this repository you will find:  
* [dataset_scripts](https://github.com/Chim-SO/MNIST_classification/tree/main/dataset_scripts) : scriptes to create and describe the dataset.
* [main_classification_convnet.py](https://github.com/Chim-SO/MNIST_classification/blob/main/main_classification_convnet.py): the CNN-based model.
* [main_classification_onehot.py](https://github.com/Chim-SO/MNIST_classification/blob/main/main_classification_onehot.py) : the model model with one-hot encoded output.
* [main_classification_single_output.py](https://github.com/Chim-SO/MNIST_classification/blob/main/main_classification_single_output.py): the traightforwad model with a single output unit.
